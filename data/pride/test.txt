He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters ; said he had heard much of their beauty , but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage .
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers ; but Mrs. Bennet , who quarreled with no compliments , answered most readily .
“ You are very kind , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so , for else they will be destitute enough .
Things are settled so oddly . ” “ You allude , perhaps , to the entail of this estate . ” “ Ah !
sir , I do indeed .
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .
Not that I mean to find fault with _ you _ , for such things I know are all chance in this world .
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . ” “ I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them .
At present I will not say more ; but , perhaps , when we are better acquainted — ” He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other .
They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins ’ s admiration .
The hall , the dining-room , and all its furniture , were examined and praised ; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet ’ s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing .
But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .
He begged pardon for having displeased her .
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .
Chapter 14 During dinner , Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh ’ s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .
Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better .
Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise .
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that “ he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank — such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine .
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but _ he _ had never seen anything but affability in her .
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations .
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage , where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself — some shelves in the closet up stairs . ” “ That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman .
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her .
Does she live near you , sir ? ” “ The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship ’ s residence . ” “ I think you said she was a widow , sir ?
Has she any family ? ” “ She has only one daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property . ” “ Ah ! ” said Mrs. Bennet , shaking her head , “ then she is better off than many girls .
And what sort of young lady is she ?
Is she handsome ? ” “ She is a most charming young lady indeed .
Lady Catherine herself says that , in point of true beauty , Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex , because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth .
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of , as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them .
But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . ” “ Has she been presented ?
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . ” “ Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine one day , has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament .
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea ; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her .
These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . ” “ You judge very properly , ” said Mr. Bennet , “ and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? ” “ They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible . ” Mr. Bennet ’ s expectations were fully answered .
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and , except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .
By tea-time , however , the dose had been enough , and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again , and , when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .
Mr. Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but , on beholding it ( for everything announced it to be from a circulating library ) , he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels .
Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed .
Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce ’ s Sermons .
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with : “ Do you know , mamma , that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard ; and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him .
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday .
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town . ” Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr. Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said : “ I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit .
It amazes me , I confess ; for , certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction .
But I will no longer importune my young cousin . ” Then turning to Mr. Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .
Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia ’ s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but Mr. Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet , and prepared for backgammon .
Chapter 15 Mr. Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .
The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner ; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his right as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self-importance and humility .
Having now a good house and a very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to choose one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .
This was his plan of amends — of atonement — for inheriting their father ’ s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .
His plan did not vary on seeing them .
Miss Bennet ’ s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening _ she _ was his settled choice .
The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ’ s _ tête-à-tête _ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on .
“ As to her _ younger _ daughters , she could not take upon her to say — she could not positively answer — but she did not _ know _ of any prepossession ; her _ eldest _ daughter , she must just mention — she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . ” Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth — and it was soon done — done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire .
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .
Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces .
Lydia ’ s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr. Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr. Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast ; and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Mr. Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford .
Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly .
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr. Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely pleased to close his large book , and go .
In pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton .
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _ him _ .
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recall them .
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentlemanlike appearance , walking with another officer on the other side of the way .
The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to enquire , and he bowed as they passed .
All were struck with the stranger ’ s air , all wondered who he could be ; and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen , turning back , had reached the same spot .
Mr. Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr. Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .
This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .
His appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation — a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street .
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .
Bingley was the principal spokesman , and Miss Bennet the principal object .
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to enquire after her .
Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .
Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red .
Mr. Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat — a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return .
What could be the meaning of it ?
It was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know .
In another minute , Mr. Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Phillip ’ s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ’ s pressing entreaties that they should come in , and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips ’ s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation .
Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces ; and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones ’ s shop-boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane ’ s introduction of him .
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself , however , might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .
Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and enquiries about the other ; of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr. Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant ’ s commission in the — — shire .
She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr. Wickham appeared , Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers , who , in comparison with the stranger , were become “ stupid , disagreeable fellows . ” Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening .
This was agreed to , and Mrs. Phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .
Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be in the wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips ’ s manners and politeness .
He protested that , except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .
Something , he supposed , might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .
Chapter 16 As no objection was made to the young people ’ s engagement with their aunt , and all Mr. Collins ’ s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing-room , that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle ’ s invitation , and was then in the house .
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor — when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ’ s drawing-rooms , and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ’ s room .
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece , the interval of waiting appeared very long .
It was over at last , however .
The gentlemen did approach , and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .
The officers of the — — shire were in general a very creditable , gentlemanlike set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as _ they _ were superior to the broad-faced , stuffy uncle Phillips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room .
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .
With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers , Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips , and was by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .
When the card-tables were placed , he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn , by sitting down to whist .
“ I know little of the game at present , ” said he , “ but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation in life — ” Mrs. Phillips was very glad for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason .
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia .
At first there seemed danger of Lydia ’ s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular .
Allowing for the common demands of the game , Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told — the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy .
She dared not even mention that gentleman .
Her curiosity , however , was unexpectedly relieved .
Mr. Wickham began the subject himself .
He enquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there .
“ About a month , ” said Elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , “ He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . ” “ Yes , ” replied Mr. Wickham ; “ his estate there is a noble one .
A clear ten thousand per annum .
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself , for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . ” Elizabeth could not but look surprised .
“ You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday .
Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy ? ” “ As much as I ever wish to be , ” cried Elizabeth very warmly .
“ I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . ” “ I have no right to give _ my _ opinion , ” said Wickham , “ as to his being agreeable or otherwise .
I am not qualified to form one .
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .
It is impossible for _ me _ to be impartial .
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish — and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else .
Here you are in your own family . ” “ Upon my word , I say no more _ here _ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield .
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire .
Everybody is disgusted with his pride .
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone . ” “ I cannot pretend to be sorry , ” said Wickham , after a short interruption , “ that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _ him _ I believe it does not often happen .
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chooses to be seen . ” “ I should take him , even on _ my _ slight acquaintance , to be an ill-tempered man . ” Wickham only shook his head .
“ I wonder , ” said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , “ whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . ” “ I do not at all know ; but I _ heard _ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield .
I hope your plans in favour of the — — shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . ” “ Oh !
no — it is not for _ me _ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy .
If _ he _ wishes to avoid seeing _ me _ , he must go .
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding _ him _ but what I might proclaim before all the world , a sense of very great ill-usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is .
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr. Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . ” Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented further enquiry .
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .
“ It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , ” he added , “ which was my chief inducement to enter the — — shire .
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them .
Society , I own , is necessary to me .
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .
I _ must _ have employment and society .
A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible .
The church _ ought _ to have been my profession — I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . ” “ Indeed ! ” “ Yes — the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .
He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me .
I cannot do justice to his kindness .
He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . ” “ Good heavens ! ” cried Elizabeth ; “ but how could _ that _ be ?
How could his will be disregarded ?
Why did you not seek legal redress ? ” “ There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it — or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence — in short anything or nothing .
Certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it .
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may have spoken my opinion _ of _ him , and _ to _ him , too freely .
I can recall nothing worse .
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . ” “ This is quite shocking !
He deserves to be publicly disgraced . ” “ Some time or other he _ will _ be — but it shall not be by _ me _ .
Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose _ him _ . ” Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .
“ But what , ” said she , after a pause , “ can have been his motive ?
What can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? ” “ A thorough , determined dislike of me — a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .
Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ’ s uncommon attachment to me irritated him , I believe , very early in life .
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood — the sort of preference which was often given me . ” “ I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this — though I have never liked him .
I had not thought so very ill of him .
I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this . ” After a few minutes ’ reflection , however , she continued , “ I _ do _ remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .
His disposition must be dreadful . ” “ I will not trust myself on the subject , ” replied Wickham ; “ _ I _ can hardly be just to him . ” Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , “ To treat in such a manner the godson , the friend , the favourite of his father ! ” She could have added , “ A young man , too , like _ you _ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable ” — but she contented herself with , “ and one , too , who had probably been his companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! ” “ We were born in the same parish , within the same park ; the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care .
_ My _ father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr. Phillips , appears to do so much credit to — but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property .
He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend .
Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ’ s active superintendence , and when , immediately before my father ’ s death , Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _ him _ , as of his affection to myself . ” “ How strange ! ” cried Elizabeth .
“ How abominable !
I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you !
If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest — for dishonesty I must call it . ” “ It _ is _ wonderful , ” replied Wickham , “ for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride had often been his best friend .
It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling .
But we are none of us consistent , and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride . ” “ Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good ? ” “ Yes .
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .
Family pride , and _ filial _ pride — for he is very proud of what his father was — have done this .
Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive .
He has also _ brotherly _ pride , which , with _ some _ brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister , and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . ” “ What sort of girl is Miss Darcy ? ” He shook his head .
“ I wish I could call her amiable .
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy .
But she is too much like her brother — very , very proud .
As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .
But she is nothing to me now .
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and , I understand , highly accomplished .
Since her father ’ s death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . ” After many pauses and many trials of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying : “ I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley !
How can Mr. Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?
How can they suit each other ?
Do you know Mr. Bingley ? ” “ Not at all . ” “ He is a sweet-tempered , amiable , charming man .
He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is . ” “ Probably not ; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses .
He does not want abilities .
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous .
His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable — allowing something for fortune and figure . ” The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips .
The usual enquiries as to his success were made by the latter .
It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged that she would not make herself uneasy .
“ I know very well , madam , ” said he , “ that when persons sit down to a card-table , they must take their chances of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object .
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . ” Mr. Wickham ’ s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh .
“ Lady Catherine de Bourgh , ” she replied , “ has very lately given him a living .
I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . ” “ You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy . ” “ No , indeed , I did not .
I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine ’ s connections .
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . ” “ Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . ” This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley .
Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self-destined for another .
“ Mr.
Collins , ” said she , “ speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . ” “ I believe her to be both in a great degree , ” replied Wickham ; “ I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she <unk> part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . ” Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together , with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards , and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham ’ s attentions .
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips ’ s supper party , but his manners recommended him to everybody .
Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done <unk> .
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him .
She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent .
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won ; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his <unk> at whist , enumerating all the <unk> at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House .
Chapter 17 Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself .
Jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley ’ s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham .
The possibility of his having endured such <unk> , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing remained therefore to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained .
“ They have both , ” said she , “ been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .
<unk> people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <unk> them , without actual blame on either side . ” “ Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?
Do clear _ them _ too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . ” “ <unk> as much as you choose , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy , to be <unk> his father ’ s favourite in such a manner , one whom his father had promised to provide for .
It is impossible .
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?
Oh !
no . ” “ I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley ’ s being imposed on , than that Mr. Wickham should <unk> such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , <unk> , everything mentioned without ceremony .
If it be not so , let Mr. Darcy contradict it .
Besides , there was truth in his looks . ” “ It is difficult indeed — it is distressing .
One does not know what to think . ” “ I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . ” But Jane could think with certainty on only one point — that Mr. Bingley , if he _ had been _ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery , where this conversation passed , by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the <unk> ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday .
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .
To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet ’ s civilities .
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .
Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .
Jane <unk> to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy ’ s look and behaviour .
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was , at any rate , a ball .
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .
“ While I can have my mornings to myself , ” said she , “ it is enough — I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .
Society has claims on us all ; and I <unk> myself one of those who consider intervals of <unk> and amusement as desirable for everybody . ” Elizabeth ’ s spirits were so high on this occasion , that though she did not often speak <unk> to Mr. Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley ’ s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ’ s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from <unk> a <unk> either from the <unk> , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by <unk> to dance .
“ I am by no means of the opinion , I assure you , ” said he , “ that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself , that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening ; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . ” Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .
She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances ; and to have Mr. Collins instead !
her liveliness had never been worse <unk> .
There was no help for it , however .
Mr. Wickham ’ s happiness and her own were <unk> delayed a little longer , and Mr. Collins ’ s proposal accepted with as good a <unk> as she could .
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more .
It now first struck her , that _ she _ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to _ her _ .
Elizabeth , however , did not choose to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .
Mr. Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a <unk> of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once .
No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after — the very <unk> for Netherfield were got by <unk> .
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a <unk> , Saturday , Sunday , and Monday <unk> to Kitty and Lydia .
Chapter 18 Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield , and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the <unk> of red <unk> there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not <unk> have alarmed her .
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained <unk> of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely <unk> for Mr. Darcy ’ s pleasure in the Bingleys ’ invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , “ I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here . ” This part of his intelligence , though <unk> by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and , as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ’ s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .
<unk> , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was <unk> to Wickham .
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly <unk> even in speaking to Mr. Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her <unk> to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary <unk> to the <unk> of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .
The first two dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .
Mr. Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .
The moment of her <unk> from him was ecstasy .
She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .
When those dances were over , she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; Charlotte tried to console her : “ I dare say you will find him very agreeable . ” “ Heaven forbid !
_ That _ would be the greatest misfortune of all !
To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !
Do not wish me such an evil . ” When the dancing <unk> , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper , not to be a simpleton , and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence .
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ’ looks , their equal amazement in beholding it .
They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .
He replied , and was again silent .
After a pause of some minutes , she addressed him a second time with : — “ It is _ your _ turn to say something now , Mr. Darcy .
_ I _ talked about the dance , and _ you _ ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room , or the number of <unk> . ” He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .
“ Very well .
That reply will do for the present .
Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .
But _ now _ we may be silent . ” “ Do you talk by rule , then , while you are dancing ? ” “ Sometimes .
One must speak a little , you know .
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together ; and yet for the advantage of _ some _ , conversation ought to be so arranged , as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . ” “ Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? ” “ Both , ” replied Elizabeth archly ; “ for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .
We are each of an <unk> , <unk> disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will <unk> the whole room , and be handed down to <unk> with all the _ <unk> _ of a <unk> . ” “ This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , ” said he .
“ How near it may be to _ mine _ , I cannot pretend to say .
_ You _ think it a faithful <unk> undoubtedly . ” “ I must not decide on my own performance . ” He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton .
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , “ When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . ” The effect was immediate .
A deeper shade of _ hauteur _ overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .
At length Darcy spoke , and in a <unk> manner said , “ Mr.
Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _ making _ friends — whether he may be equally capable of _ retaining _ them , is less certain . ” “ He has been so unlucky as to lose _ your _ friendship , ” replied Elizabeth with <unk> , “ and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . ” Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .
At that moment , Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy , he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .
“ I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir .
Such very superior dancing is not often seen .
It is evident that you belong to the first <unk> .
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Eliza ( glancing at her sister and Bingley ) shall take place .
What congratulations will then flow in !
I appeal to Mr. Darcy : — but let me not interrupt you , sir .
You will not thank me for detaining you from the <unk> converse of that young lady , whose <unk> eyes are also <unk> me . ” The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William ’ s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together .
<unk> himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , “ Sir William ’ s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . ” “ I do not think we were speaking at all .
Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .
We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . ” “ What think you of books ? ” said he , smiling .
“ <unk> — oh !
no .
I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . ” “ I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject .
We may <unk> our different opinions . ” “ No — I cannot talk of books in a ball-room ; my head is always full of something else . ” “ The _ present _ always <unk> you in such scenes — does it ? ” said he , with a look of doubt .
“ Yes , always , ” she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , “ I remember hearing you once say , Mr. Darcy , that you hardly ever <unk> , that your resentment once created was <unk> .
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its _ being created ? _ ” “ I am , ” said he , with a firm voice .
“ And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? ” “ I hope not . ” “ It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . ” “ May I ask to what these questions <unk> ? ” “ <unk> to the <unk> of _ your _ character , ” said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .
“ I am trying to make it out . ” “ And what is your success ? ” She shook her head .
“ I do not get on at all .
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . ” “ I can readily believe , ” answered he gravely , “ that reports may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . ” “ But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . ” “ I would by no means <unk> any pleasure of yours , ” he coldly replied .
She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; and on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy ’ s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .
They had not long separated , when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her : “ So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham !
Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you , among his other communication , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr. Darcy ’ s steward .
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give <unk> confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr. Darcy ’ s using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has always been remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner .
I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .
His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ’ s guilt ; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ” “ His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , ” said Elizabeth <unk> ; “ for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy ’ s steward , and of _ that _ , I can assure you , he informed me himself . ” “ I beg your pardon , ” replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a <unk> .
“ Excuse my interference — it was kindly meant . ” “ <unk> girl ! ” said Elizabeth to herself .
“ You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy . ” She then sought her eldest sister , who had <unk> to make enquiries on the same subject of Bingley .
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .
Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his <unk> , and everything else , gave way before the hope of Jane ’ s being in the <unk> way for happiness .
“ I want to know , ” said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ’ s , “ what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham .
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ” “ No , ” replied Jane , “ I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .
Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the <unk> , and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister ’ s , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy ’ s regard . ” “ Mr.
Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself ? ” “ No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . ” “ This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy .
I am satisfied .
But what does he say of the living ? ” “ He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once , but he <unk> that it was left to him _ conditionally _ only . ” “ I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley ’ s sincerity , ” said Elizabeth warmly ; “ but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .
Mr. Bingley ’ s <unk> of his friend was a very able one , I dare say ; but since he is <unk> with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before . ” She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley ’ s regard , and said all in her power to <unk> her confidence in it .
On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr. Collins came up to them , and told her with great <unk> that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .
“ I have found out , ” said he , “ by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine .
How wonderfully these sort of things occur !
Who would have thought of my meeting with , perhaps , a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly !
I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . ” “ You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy ! ” “ Indeed I am .
I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .
I believe him to be Lady Catherine ’ s _ nephew _ .
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ’ <unk> . ” Elizabeth tried hard to <unk> him from such a scheme , assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side ; and that if it were , it must belong to Mr. Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .
Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and , when she ceased speaking , replied thus : “ My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the <unk> of your understanding ; but <unk> me to say , that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the <unk> , and those which <unk> the <unk> ; for , give me leave to observe that I consider the <unk> office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom — provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .
You must therefore allow me to follow the <unk> of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty .
Pardon me for neglecting to <unk> by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and <unk> study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . ” And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy , whose reception of his <unk> she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .
Her cousin <unk> his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the <unk> of his lips the words “ apology , ” “ Hunsford , ” and “ Lady Catherine de Bourgh . ” It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .
Mr. Darcy was <unk> him with <unk> wonder , and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .
Mr. Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr. Darcy ’ s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .
Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth .
“ I have no reason , I assure you , ” said he , “ to be dissatisfied with my reception .
Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ’ s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <unk> .
It was really a very handsome thought .
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . ” As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley ; and the <unk> of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane .
She saw her in idea settled in that very house , in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable , under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley ’ s two sisters .
Her mother ’ s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley .
It was an <unk> subject , and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self-gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .
It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ’ s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and <unk> , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to <unk> her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life .
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ’ s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <unk> whisper ; for , to her <unk> vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy , who sat opposite to them .
Her mother only <unk> her for being nonsensical .
“ What is Mr. Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ?
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _ he _ may not like to hear . ” “ For heaven ’ s sake , madam , speak lower .
What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy ?
You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing ! ” Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .
At length , however , Mrs. Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long <unk> at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold <unk> and <unk> .
Elizabeth now began to <unk> .
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for , when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .
By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of <unk> was delightful to her , and she began her song .
Elizabeth ’ s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations , and she watched her progress through the several <unk> with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving , amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .
Mary ’ s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected .
Elizabeth was in <unk> .
She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley .
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making <unk> of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued , however , <unk> grave .
She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night .
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , “ That will do extremely well , child .
You have delighted us long enough .
Let the other young ladies have time to <unk> . ” Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth , sorry for her , and sorry for her father ’ s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .
<unk> of the party were now applied to .
“ If I , ” said Mr. Collins , “ were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .
I do not mean , however , to assert that we can be justified in <unk> too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .
The rector of a parish has much to do .
In the first place , he must make such an agreement for <unk> as may be <unk> to himself and not offensive to his patron .
He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible .
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and <unk> manners towards everybody , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .
I cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should <unk> an occasion of <unk> his respect towards anybody connected with the family . ” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .
Many stared — many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a <unk> to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .
To Elizabeth it appeared that , had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .
That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of <unk> her relations , was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement .
She was teased by Mr. Collins , who continued most <unk> by her side , and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .
He assured her , that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .
There was no <unk> upon such a <unk> .
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and <unk> engaged Mr. Collins ’ s conversation to herself .
She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy ’ s further notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham , and rejoiced in it .
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart , and , by a <unk> of Mrs. Bennet , had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .
Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths , except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .
They <unk> every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation , and by so doing threw a <unk> over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins , who was <unk> Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their <unk> .
Darcy said nothing at all .
Mr. Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “ Lord , how tired I am ! ” accompanied by a violent yawn .
When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs. Bennet was most <unk> civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn , and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .
Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied , and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of <unk> , new carriages , and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months .
Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _ her _ , the worth of each was <unk> by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield .
Chapter 19 The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn .
Mr. Collins made his declaration in form .
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very <unk> manner , with all the <unk> , which he supposed a regular part of the business .
On finding Mrs. Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words : “ May I hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? ” Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise , Mrs. Bennet answered instantly , “ Oh dear ! — yes — certainly .
I am sure Lizzy will be very happy — I am sure she can have no objection .
Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs . ” And , <unk> her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out : “ Dear madam , do not go .
I beg you will not go .
Mr. Collins must excuse me .
He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear .
I am going away myself . ” “ No , no , nonsense , Lizzy .
I desire you to stay where you are . ” And upon Elizabeth ’ s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added : “ Lizzy , I _ insist _ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins . ” Elizabeth would not oppose such an <unk> — and a moment ’ s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again and tried to conceal , by <unk> employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .
Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone , Mr. Collins began .
“ Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any <unk> , rather adds to your other perfections .
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _ not _ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you , that I have your respected mother ’ s permission for this address .
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to <unk> ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .
<unk> as soon as I entered the house , I singled you out as the companion of my future life .
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying — and , moreover , for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of <unk> a wife , as I certainly did . ” The idea of Mr. Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing , that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further , and he continued : “ My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly — which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness .
<unk> has she condescended to give me her opinion ( <unk> too ! )
on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford — between our <unk> at quadrille , while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh ’ s <unk> , that she said , ‘ Mr.
Collins , you must marry .
A clergyman like you must marry .
<unk> properly , choose a <unk> for _ my _ sake ; and for your _ own _ , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way .
This is my advice .
<unk> such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ’ Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not <unk> the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .
You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , I think , must be acceptable to her , especially when <unk> with the silence and respect which her rank will <unk> excite .
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I can assure you there are many amiable young women .
But the fact is , that being , as I am , to <unk> this estate after the death of your honoured father ( who , however , may live many years longer ) , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place — which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years .
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the four per <unk> , which will not be yours till after your mother ’ s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . ” It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .
“ You are too hasty , sir , ” she cried .
“ You forget that I have made no answer .
Let me do it without further loss of time .
<unk> my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them . ” “ I am not now to learn , ” replied Mr. Collins , with a formal <unk> of the hand , “ that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first <unk> for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second , or even a third time .
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the <unk> ere long . ” “ Upon my word , sir , ” cried Elizabeth , “ your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration .
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .
I am perfectly serious in my refusal .
You could not make _ me _ happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so .
Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . ” “ Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , ” said Mr. Collins very gravely — “ but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all <unk> of you .
And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again , I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable <unk> . ” “ Indeed , Mr. Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .
You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say .
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach .
This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . ” And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her : “ When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from <unk> you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . ” “ <unk> , Mr. Collins , ” cried Elizabeth with some warmth , “ you puzzle me exceedingly .
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one . ” “ You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .
My reasons for believing it are briefly these : It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable .
My situation in life , my connections with the family of de Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into further consideration , that in spite of your <unk> attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable <unk> .
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . ” “ I do assure you , sir , that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which <unk> in <unk> a respectable man .
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .
My feelings in every respect forbid it .
Can I speak <unk> ?
Do not consider me now as an elegant female , intending to plague you , but as a rational creature , speaking the truth from her heart . ” “ You are uniformly charming ! ” cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; “ and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . ” To such perseverance in wilful <unk> Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated <unk> as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and <unk> of an elegant female .
Chapter 20 Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs. Bennet , having <unk> about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast-room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .
Mr. Collins received and returned these <unk> with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her <unk> modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .
This information , however , startled Mrs. Bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not believe it , and could not help saying so .
“ But , depend upon it , Mr. Collins , ” she added , “ that Lizzy shall be brought to reason .
I will speak to her about it directly .
She is a very headstrong , foolish girl , and does not know her own interest but I will _ make _ her know it . ” “ Pardon me for interrupting you , madam , ” cried Mr. Collins ; “ but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .
If therefore she actually <unk> in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . ” “ Sir , you quite misunderstand me , ” said Mrs. Bennet , alarmed .
“ Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .
In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived .
I will go directly to Mr. Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . ” She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , “ Oh !
Mr. Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an <unk> .
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins , for she <unk> she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _ her _ . ” Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .
“ I have not the pleasure of understanding you , ” said he , when she had finished her speech .
“ Of what are you talking ? ” “ Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy .
Lizzy <unk> she will not have Mr. Collins , and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . ” “ And what am I to do on the occasion ?
It seems an hopeless business . ” “ <unk> to Lizzy about it yourself .
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . ” “ Let her be called down .
She shall hear my opinion . ” Mrs. Bennet <unk> the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library .
“ Come here , child , ” cried her father as she appeared .
“ I have sent for you on an affair of importance .
I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage .
Is it true ? ” Elizabeth replied that it was .
“ Very well — and this offer of marriage you have refused ? ” “ I have , sir . ” “ Very well .
We now come to the point .
Your mother <unk> upon your accepting it .
Is it not so , Mrs. Bennet ? ” “ Yes , or I will never see her again . ” “ An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth .
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .
Your mother will never see you again if you do _ not _ marry Mr. Collins , and I will never see you again if you _ do _ . ” Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning , but Mrs. Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .
“ What do you mean , Mr. Bennet , in talking this way ?
You promised me to _ insist _ upon her marrying him . ” “ My dear , ” replied her husband , “ I have two small favours to request .
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room .
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . ” Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs. Bennet give up the point .
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; <unk> and <unk> her by turns .
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest ; but Jane , with all possible mildness , declined <unk> ; and Elizabeth , sometimes with real earnestness , and sometimes with playful gaiety , replied to her attacks .
Though her manner varied , however , her determination never did .
Mr. Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .
His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ’ s reproach prevented his feeling any regret .
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them .
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , “ I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here !
What do you think has happened this morning ?
Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . ” Charlotte hardly had time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news ; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room , where Mrs. Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and <unk> her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .
“ Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , ” she added in a melancholy tone , “ for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me .
I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . ” Charlotte ’ s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth .
“ Aye , there she comes , ” continued Mrs. Bennet , “ looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at <unk> , provided she can have her own way .
But I tell you , Miss Lizzy — if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all — and I am sure I do not know who is to <unk> you when your father is dead .
_ I _ shall not be able to keep you — and so I warn you .
I have done with you from this very day .
I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .
I have no pleasure in talking to <unk> children .
Not that I have much pleasure , indeed , in talking to anybody .
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .
Nobody can tell what I suffer !
But it is always so .
Those who do not complain are never pitied . ” Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with her or <unk> her would only increase the irritation .
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them , till they were joined by Mr. Collins , who entered the room with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , “ Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your <unk> , and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together . ” Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins , whose enquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .
In a <unk> voice Mrs. Bennet began the <unk> conversation : “ Oh !
Mr. Collins ! ” “ My dear madam , ” replied he , “ let us be for ever silent on this point .
Far be it from me , ” he presently continued , in a voice that marked his displeasure , “ to resent the behaviour of your daughter .
<unk> to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned .
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that <unk> is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .
You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus <unk> my pretensions to your daughter ’ s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to <unk> your authority in my behalf .
My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my <unk> from your daughter ’ s lips instead of your own .
But we are all liable to error .
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair .
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my _ manner _ has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . ” Chapter 21 The discussion of Mr. Collins ’ s offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother .
As for the gentleman himself , _ his _ feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .
He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the <unk> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were <unk> for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him was a <unk> relief to them all , and especially to her friend .
The morrow produced no <unk> of Mrs. Bennet ’ s ill-humour or ill health .
Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride .
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might <unk> his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .
He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he meant to stay .
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to enquire if Mr. Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball .
He joined them on their entering the town , and attended them to their aunt ’ s where his regret and vexation , and the concern of everybody , was well talked over .
To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _ had _ been <unk> .
“ I found , ” said he , “ as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . ” She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk he particularly attended to her .
His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield .
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , <unk> paper , well covered with a lady ’ s fair , <unk> hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ’ s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs .
When they had gained their own room , Jane , taking out the letter , said : “ This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it <unk> has surprised me a good deal .
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town — and without any intention of coming back again .
You shall hear what she says . ” She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street , where Mr. Hurst had a house .
The next was in these words : “ I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope , at some future period , to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known , and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .
I depend on you for that . ” To these <unk> expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the <unk> of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley ’ s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .
“ It is unlucky , ” said she , after a short pause , “ that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?
Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them . ” “ Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter .
I will read it to you : ” “ When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days ; but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles <unk> to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a <unk> <unk> .
Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter ; I wish that I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one of the <unk> — but of that I <unk> .
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may <unk> in the gaieties which that season generally <unk> , and that your <unk> will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall <unk> you . ” “ It is evident by this , ” added Jane , “ that he comes back no more this winter . ” “ It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _ should _ . ” “ Why will you think so ?
It must be his own doing .
He is his own master .
But you do not know _ all _ .
I _ will _ read you the passage which particularly <unk> me .
I will have no reserves from _ you _ . ” “ Mr.
Darcy is impatient to see his sister ; and , to confess the truth , _ we _ are scarcely less eager to meet her again .
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she <unk> in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister .
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject ; but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .
My brother admires her greatly already ; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ; and a sister ’ s partiality is not <unk> me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ’ s heart .
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment , and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in <unk> the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? ” “ What do you think of _ this _ sentence , my dear Lizzy ? ” said Jane as she finished it .
“ Is it not clear enough ?
Does it not <unk> declare that Caroline neither <unk> nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ’ s indifference ; and that if she <unk> the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ! )
to put me on my guard ?
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? ” “ Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different .
Will you hear it ? ” “ Most willingly . ” “ You shall have it in a few words .
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy .
She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there , and <unk> to persuade you that he does not care about you . ” Jane shook her head .
“ Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me .
No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection .
Miss Bingley , I am sure , cannot .
She is not such a simpleton .
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .
But the case is this : We are not rich enough or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _ one _ <unk> , she may have less trouble in <unk> a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way .
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley <unk> you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _ your _ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . ” “ If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , ” replied Jane , “ your representation of all this might make me quite easy .
But I know the foundation is unjust .
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself . ” “ That is right .
You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .
Believe her to be deceived , by all means .
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . ” “ But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? ” “ You must decide for yourself , ” said Elizabeth ; “ and if , upon <unk> deliberation , you find that the misery of <unk> his two sisters is more than <unk> to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . ” “ How can you talk so ? ” said Jane , <unk> smiling .
“ You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . ” “ I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion . ” “ But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .
A thousand things may arise in six months ! ” The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .
It appeared to her merely the <unk> of Caroline ’ s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or <unk> spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone .
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .
Jane ’ s temper was not <unk> , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .
They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ’ s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she <unk> it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together .
After <unk> it , however , at some length , she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration , that though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .
Chapter 22 The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins .
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .
“ It keeps him in good humour , ” said she , “ and I am more obliged to you than I can express . ” Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .
This was very amiable , but Charlotte ’ s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any <unk> of ; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins ’ s addresses , by engaging them towards herself .
Such was Miss Lucas ’ s scheme ; and <unk> were so favourable , that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon .
But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and <unk> to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her <unk> .
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively <unk> since the adventure of Wednesday .
His reception , however , was of the most flattering kind .
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane .
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and <unk> <unk> her there .
In as short a time as Mr. Collins ’ s long speeches would allow , everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be <unk> for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .
The stupidity with which he was <unk> by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .
Mr. Collins ’ s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate , with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James ’ s .
The whole family , in short , were properly <unk> on the occasion .
The younger girls formed hopes of _ coming out _ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte ’ s dying an old maid .
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed .
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it .
Her reflections were in general satisfactory .
Mr. Collins , to be sure , was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .
But still he would be her husband .
Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only provision for <unk> young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their <unk> preservative from want .
This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty-seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .
The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation .
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore <unk> Mr. Collins , when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to <unk> , and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial , for he was longing to <unk> his prosperous love .
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of <unk> was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs. Bennet , with great politeness and cordiality , said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them .
“ My dear madam , ” he replied , “ this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall <unk> myself of it as soon as possible . ” They were all astonished ; and Mr. Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said : “ But is there not danger of Lady Catherine ’ s disapprobation here , my good sir ?
You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness . ” “ My dear sir , ” replied Mr. Collins , “ I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ’ s concurrence . ” “ You cannot be too much upon your guard .
<unk> anything rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that _ we _ shall take no offence . ” “ Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire .
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . ” With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return .
Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .
She <unk> his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers , he might become a very agreeable companion .
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before .
The possibility of Mr. Collins ’ s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the <unk> of decorum , and she could not help crying out : “ <unk> to Mr. Collins !
My dear Charlotte — impossible ! ” The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon <unk> her composure , and <unk> replied : “ Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ?
Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to <unk> any woman ’ s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? ” But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure with tolerable <unk> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .
“ I see what you are feeling , ” replied Charlotte .
“ You must be surprised , very much surprised — so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you .
But when you have had time to think it over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done .
I am not <unk> , you know ; I never was .
I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr. Collins ’ s character , connection , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . ” Elizabeth quietly answered “ Undoubtedly ; ” and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .
The <unk> of Mr. Collins ’ s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .
She had always felt that Charlotte ’ s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she had not supposed it to be possible that , when called into <unk> , she would have <unk> every better feeling to worldly advantage .
Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture !
And to the <unk> of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .
Chapter 23 Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , <unk> on what she had heard , and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter , to announce her engagement to the family .
With many compliments to them , and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter — to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs. Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken ; and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , <unk> exclaimed : “ Good Lord !
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ?
Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? ” Nothing less than the complaisance of a <unk> could have borne without anger such treatment ; but Sir William ’ s good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most <unk> courtesy .
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to <unk> his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr. Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .
Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .
In the first place , she persisted in <unk> the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and <unk> , that the match might be broken off .
Two <unk> , however , were plainly <unk> from the whole : one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief ; and the other that she herself had been <unk> <unk> by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .
Nothing could console and nothing could <unk> her .
Nor did that day <unk> out her resentment .
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .
Mr. Bennet ’ s <unk> were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .
Kitty and Lydia were far from <unk> Miss Lucas , for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton .
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to <unk> on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs. Bennet ’ s <unk> looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them <unk> silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever <unk> between them again .
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose <unk> and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return .
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was <unk> the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .
The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ’ s abode in the family might have <unk> .
After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an <unk> argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .
Mr. Collins ’ s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet .
On the contrary , she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .
It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <unk> .
She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .
Such were the gentle <unk> of Mrs. Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley ’ s continued absence .
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .
<unk> after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .
Even Elizabeth began to fear — not that Bingley was indifferent — but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .
<unk> as she was to admit an idea so <unk> of Jane ’ s happiness , and so <unk> to the <unk> of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently occurring .
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his <unk> friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .
As for Jane , _ her _ anxiety under this suspense was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ’ s , but whatever she felt she was desirous of <unk> , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .
But as no such delicacy <unk> her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used .
It needed all Jane ’ s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of <unk> relieved them from a great deal of his company .
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .
Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state .
The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an <unk> of ill-humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her .
As her <unk> in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .
<unk> Charlotte came to see them , she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead .
She <unk> bitterly of all this to her husband .
“ Indeed , Mr. Bennet , ” said she , “ it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that _ I _ should be forced to make way for _ her _ , and live to see her take her place in it ! ” “ My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .
Let us hope for better things .
Let us flatter ourselves that _ I _ may be the <unk> . ” This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet , and therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before .
“ I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .
If it was not for the entail , I should not mind it . ” “ What should not you mind ? ” “ I should not mind anything at all . ” “ Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . ” “ I never can be thankful , Mr. Bennet , for anything about the entail .
How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ’ s own daughters , I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too !
Why should _ he _ have it more than anybody else ? ” “ I leave it to yourself to determine , ” said Mr. Bennet .
Chapter 24 Miss Bingley ’ s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother ’ s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country .
<unk> was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .
Miss Darcy ’ s praise occupied the chief of it .
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted <unk> of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to <unk> the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ’ s being an <unk> of Mr. Darcy ’ s house , and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .
Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all others .
To Caroline ’ s assertion of her brother ’ s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit .
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution , which now made him the slave of his <unk> friends , and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination .
